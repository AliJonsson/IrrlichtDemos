/* TODO -------------------------------------------------------------------

- Where's line2line function from?

- I only collect 1X in the manager, while during entity->collide I do it 
  multiple times! --> Collect only if it's needed - when the current 
  tunnel (based on the current prevPos, pos) is not fully inside the main
  tunnel (based on the main travel vector), then a new collection should
  be made. Otherwise, (frame coherence:) the previously collected data can
  be used:
    SCollDataCache
    {
      CCollEntity* entity;
      CCollObject* object;
      core::list<CCollTriangloid> selectedTris;
    }

- RayIntersect could also create a list of possible colliders first:
  one for the objects and the other for the entities it can hit by
  it's full length.

- [API] More feedback from the functions, what did 
  they do, succeeded or not, etc.

- [API] Selectors: add setMesh and setMeshBuffer functions, that would 
  automatically build too. Get rid of the add_ functions from 
  CCollTerrainSelector, and use set_ functions only.

- CCollManager-> AddForceInRadius, AddImpulseInRadius

- CCollBBoxSelector: setFromBBox(aabb)

- Gravity should not be affected by the base friction that much --> 
  so that entities could have different friction values

(- Safety: COLL_MAX_MOVEMENT_SQ and COLL_MAX_TIME_CYCLES)

(- More detailed, separated documentation file (.html) with images)

- Add 3rd person camera to the demo (code is almost ready for this).

- Ball physics ... as for rotation (got the code for it).

- Ability to change the height of samplers (e.g. crouching)

(- BVH selector, top-down and bottom-up build possibilities.)

- Collision groups

(- Triggers (different gravity zones, for example: ladders))

(- Particle collison. (Group the particles into one!))

(- Semi-dynamic objects (moveing platforms, doors, etc))


Shadowlair suggested:

- [BUG] Gravity should be affected by mass too! (You're right, I've 
  forgotten this one out XD)

- [BUG] RayIntersect bug when units are small or when numSegments == 1.

- standValue and slideValue --> Defineing by unit heights?

- Unified unit size in meters, unified force and impulse calculations.
  Also would affect some const values.

- Some new mass measurement: kilograms?
