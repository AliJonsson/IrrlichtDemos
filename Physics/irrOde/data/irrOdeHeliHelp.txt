 Cursor Left/Right: Roll
 Cursor Up/Down: Pitch
 A/D: Yaw
 W: increase engine power
 S: decrease engine power
 SPACE: fire missile
 C: toggle follow missile camera
 
Some notes

I know, I know ... this is fun but not really realistic ... but realism was not the main goal when I decided to integrate a helicopter.
