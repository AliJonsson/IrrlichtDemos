Textures go here.. 

About every image format which is ready to put in-game.. NO PSD FILES!!!

Name syntax:
OBJECTNAME_Texture

lightmap would be:
OBJECTNAME_Lightmap


IF working with shaders:
This way it is easy to keep files for shaders manageable like:

OBJECTNAME_DiffuseTexture
OBJECTNAME_SpecularTexture
ETC..
